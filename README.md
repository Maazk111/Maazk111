# 👋 Hi, I'm **Muhammad Maaz Khan**

### 🚀 DevOps Engineer | Cloud & Automation Enthusiast | Full Stack Developer

_Building scalable, automated cloud systems through DevOps excellence._

I’m a **DevOps Engineer**, gaining hands-on experience in **AWS, CI/CD, Terraform, Jenkins, Ansible, and Docker.**  
I enjoy working with **cloud infrastructure, Infrastructure-as-Code**, and **Kubernetes** to build reliable and scalable systems.

Alongside DevOps, I also have experience in **Full Stack Development** using **Node.js, Express.js, React, JavaScript, MySQL, and MongoDB**, which helps me understand applications from both the **development and deployment** sides.

I’m currently in my **7th semester at DHA Suffa University**, where I’m learning **Agentic AI frameworks** such as **LangChain, LangGraph, and CrewAI** as part of my **Final Year Project (AutoTestGen+).**

I’m passionate about **learning, improving automation workflows**, and **creating efficient, well-structured environments** for teams and projects.
