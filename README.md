# 👋 Hi, I'm **Muhammad Maaz Khan**

### 🚀 DevOps Engineer | Cloud & Automation Enthusiast | Full Stack Developer
*Building scalable, automated cloud systems through DevOps excellence.*

I’m a **DevOps Engineer** with practical experience in **AWS, CI/CD, Terraform, Jenkins, Ansible, and Docker.**  
I enjoy working with **cloud infrastructure, infrastructure as code, and Kubernetes** to build reliable and scalable systems.

Alongside DevOps, I also have experience in **Full Stack Development** using **Node.js, Express.js, React, JavaScript, MySQL and MongoDB**,  
which helps me understand applications from both the **development and deployment** sides.

I’m passionate about **learning, improving automation workflows**, and **creating efficient, well-structured environments** for teams and projects.
